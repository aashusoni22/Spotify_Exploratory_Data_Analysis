# Spotify-ExploratoryDataAnalysis


• **Dataset used**: Spotify dataset from Kaggle.

•	**Objective:** To analyze data to find artists popularity, popular gerne, no. of songs per year and various correlations

•	**Major insights** from visualization using Matplotlib & seaborn: Strong correlation between Loudness and Energy as             compared to acousticness and Energy that means if the song is loud, it is most likely energetic. 90s music on Spotify is     less as compared to no. songs in 2000 and 2020. The most popular Gernes on Spotify are Classical and World. 

**Analysis Steps: **

• Imported Spotify dataset using Pandas

• Performed Data Exploration (looked for nulls, no. of rows & cols, transpose table).

• Analyzed data using PANDAS & NUMPY libraries (10 least & most popular songs, setting index, performed data type conversions).

• Visualized data using MATPLOTLIB, SEABORN & PANDAS to draw insights on Correlations between different variables, no. of songs per year, the popularity of artists, and   popular Genres using Barplots, Linepltos, Scatterplot, and Regressionplot.
